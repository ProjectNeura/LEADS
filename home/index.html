        <h2>LEADS VeC</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.villanovacollege.org/giving/vec-project">VeC Project</a> is the main intended
            application of LEADS. LEADS VeC initially served for this target. Yet throughout the development, it has
            become an indivisible part of LEADS. It works as the bootloader of LEADS, providing a template of how to
            make use of the framework.</p>

        <h2>LEADS Framework</h2>
        <p>LEADS framework is an excellent foundation that enables developers even with zero experience to quickly use
            Python to interact with popular hardware platforms and devices. Although it is not directly runnable, it
            sets the path for everything from embedded systems to GUI, networking, and even AI.</p>
