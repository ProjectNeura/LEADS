## Releases

Any new release of formal versions must come after at least 2 alpha versions and 2 beta versions. Each beta version must
be deployed and tested on a new testing environment following the
[User Manual](https://leads-docs.projectneura.org/en/latest/vec/user-manual.html).

## Change to APIs

Any effect on the signatures of APIs must go through a deprecation process where the original interfaces must be
marked deprecated and remain for 3 formal versions.
